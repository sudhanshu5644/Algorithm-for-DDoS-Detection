DDoS detection using Entropy Computing
Made by - Sudhanshu Ranjan

1. Presentation
    This directory contains the presentation file which provides an overview of the project.
    DDos ppt by Sudhanshu.pptx - Final presentation for the project.


2. Python Code
    Lists all the python code that are necessary to simulate. Please refer the manual directory
    for how to run the code and place the code in the requried location.

    launchTraffic.py -- to simulate traffic using scapy package
    launchAttack.py -- to launch DDOS attack on any host
    l3_editing.py -- updated existing l3_learning.py of pox controller to detect, collect flow
    statistics and prevent DDoS attack.
    detection.py -- contains algorithm to measure entropy.
    BasicFlowchart.png -- diagram illustrate the flow chart used to prevent DDoS attack
